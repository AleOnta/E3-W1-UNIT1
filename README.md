# Exercise-3-UNIT-1

This is the third exercise of the Epicode's Full-Stack course.
In this occasion, i was given the task to build a simple non-responsive web-page starting from a mockup image.
The task was to recreate the html structure of the website and work with the css to make it look similar.
I tried to commit the repository at every substantial change i was doing, but unfortunately, due to the short amount of time at my disposition, i had to rush the project
and i forgot to commit till the end.

Please note that i'm a complete noobie, this is one of the first time i'm facing with coding, but i'm here to learn.
